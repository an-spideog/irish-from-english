# Mutations
Words can cause other words in Irish to *mutate*, that is, one word can change the start of the next word.

*an* (the) adds *t-* to masculine nouns starting with vowels:
- *airgead* - *an **t-**airgead*
- *iasc* - *an **t-**iasc*

It doesn't change anything if they start with a consonant:
- *leabhar* - *an leabhar*
- *bosca* - *an bosca*
